// Strings can be enclosed within either single quotes, double quotes or backticks:
let single = 'single-quoted';
let double = "double-quoted";
let backticks = `backticks`;

// Single and double quotes are essentially the same. Backticks, however, allow us to embed any expression into the
// string, by wrapping it in ${…} :
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
alert(`1 + 2 = ${sum(1, 2)}.`);    // 1 + 2 = 3

// Another advantage of using backticks is that they allow a string to span multiple lines:
let guestList = `Guests:
* John
* Pete
* Mary
`;
alert(guestList);    // a list of guests, multiple lines
// Looks natural, right? But single or double quotes do not work this way.
// If we use them and try to use multiple lines, there’ll be an error.
// let guestList = "Guests:     // Error: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
// * John";

// It is still possible to create multiline strings with single and double quotes by using a so-called “newline
// character”, written as \n , which denotes a line break:
let guestList2 = "Guests: \n * John\n * Pete\n * Mary";
alert(guestList2);    // a multiline list of guests, same as above

// As a simpler example, these two lines are equal, just written differently:
let str1 = "Hello \nWorld";    // two lines using a "newline symbol"
// two lines using a normal newline and backticks
let str2 = `Hello 
World`;
alert(str1 == str2);

// Special Characters
//     Character            Description
//       \n                 New line
//       \r                 In Windows text files a combination of two characters \r\n represents a new break, while on
//                          non-Windows OS it’s just \n . That’s for historical reasons, most Windows software also
//                          understands \n.
//     \' \" \`             Quotes
//       \\                 Backslash
//       \t                 Tab
//     \b, \f, \v           Backspace, Form Feed, Vertical Tab – mentioned for completeness, coming from old times, not
//                          used nowadays (you can forget them right now).


// If we need to show an actual backslash \ within the string, we need to double it:
alert(`The backslash: \\`);    // The backslash: \


// So-called “escaped” quotes \' , \" , \` are used to insert a quote into the same-quoted string. For instance:
alert('I\'m the Walrus!');
// we have to prepend the inner quote by the backslash \' , because otherwise it would indicate the string end.
// Of course, only the quotes that are the same as the enclosing ones need to be escaped. So, as a more elegant solution
// we could switch to double quotes or backticks instead:
alert("I'm the Walrus!");

// String length
// The length property has the string length:
alert(`My\n`.length);    // 3
// Note that \n is a single “special” character, so the length is indeed 3


// Accessing characters
// To get a character at position pos , use square brackets [pos] or call the method str.at(pos). The first character
// starts from the zero position:
let str = `Hello`;
// the first character
alert(str[0]);    // H
alert(str.at(0));    // H
// the last character
alert(str[str.length - 1]);    // o
alert(str.at(-1));
// As you can see, the .at(pos) method has a beneﬁt of allowing negative position. If pos is negative, then it’s
// counted from the end of the string.
// We can also iterate over characters using for..of :
for (let char of "Hello") {
    alert(char);    // H, e, l, l, o (char becomes "H", then "e", then "l" etc)
}


// Strings are immutable
// Strings can’t be changed in JavaScript. It is impossible to change a character.
// Let’s try it to show that it doesn’t work:
let str3 = 'Hi';
// str3[0] = 'h';    // error
alert(str3[0]);    // doesn't work
// The usual workaround is to create a whole new string and assign it to str instead of the old one.
// For instance:
str3 = 'h' + str3[1];    // replace the string
alert(str3);    // hi


// Changing the case
// Methods toLowerCase() and toUpperCase() change the case:
alert('Interface'.toUpperCase());    // INTERFACE
alert('Interface'.toLowerCase());    // interface
// Or, if we want a single character lowercased:
alert('Interface'[0].toLowerCase());    // 'i'


// Searching for a substring
// There are multiple ways to look for a substring within a string.
// 1. str.indexOf
// The first method is str.indexOf(substr, pos).
// It looks for the substr in str , starting from the given position pos , and returns the position where the match
// was found or -1 if nothing can be found.
// For instance:
let str4 = 'Widget with id';
alert(str4.indexOf('Widget'));    // 0, because 'Widget' is found at the beginning
alert(str4.indexOf('widget'));    // -1, not found, the search is case-sensitive
alert(str4.indexOf("id"));    // 1, "id" is found at the position 1
// The optional second parameter allows us to start searching from a given position.
// For instance, the ﬁrst occurrence of "id" is at position 1 . To look for the next occurrence, let’s start the search
// from position 2 :
let str5 = 'Widget with id';
alert(str5.indexOf('id',2));    // 12
// If we’re interested in all occurrences, we can run indexOf in a loop. Every new call is made with the position after
// the previous match:
let str6 = 'As sly as a fox, as strong as an ox';
let target = "as";
let pos = -1;
while ((pos = str6.indexOf(target, pos + 1)) !== -1) {
    alert(pos)
}

// There is a slight inconvenience with indexOf in the if test. We can’t put it in the if.
// So, we should actually check for -1, like this:
let str7 = "Widget with id";
if (str7.indexOf("Widget") !== -1) {
    alert("We found it");    // Works now
}

// includes, startsWith, endsWith
// The more modern method str.includes(substr, pos) returns true/false depending on whether str contains substr within.
// It’s the right choice if we need to test for the match, but don’t need its position:
alert("Widget with id".includes("Widget"));    // true
alert("Hello".includes("Bye"));    // false
// The optional second argument of str.includes is the position to start searching from:
alert("Widget".includes("id"));    // true
alert("Widget".includes("id", 3));    // false, from position 3
// The methods str.startsWith and str.endsWith do exactly what they say:
alert("Widget".startsWith("Wid"));    // true, "Widget" starts with "Wid"
alert("Widget".endsWith("get"));    // true, "Widget" ends with "get"


// Getting a substring
// There are 3 methods in JavaScript to get a substring: substring , substr and slice .
// str.slice(start [, end])
// Returns the part of the string from start to (but not including) end .
// For instance:
let str8 = "stringify";
alert(str8.slice(0, 5));    // 'strin', the substring from 0 to 5
alert(str8.slice(0, 1));    // 's', from 0 to 1, but not including 1
// If there is no second argument, then slice goes till the end of the string:
alert(str8.slice(2));    // 'ringify', from the 2nd position till the end
// Negative values for start/end are also possible. They mean the position is counted from the string end:
// start at the 4th position from the right, end at the 1st from the right
alert(str8.slice(-4, -1));    // 'gif'
// str.substring(start [, end])
// Returns the part of the string between start and end (not including end ).
// This is almost the same as slice , but it allows start to be greater than end (in this case it simply swaps start
// and end values).
// For instance:
// these are same for substring
alert(str8.substring(2, 6));    // "ring"
alert(str8.substring(6, 2));    // "ring"
// ...but not for slice:
alert(str8.slice(2, 6));    // "ring" (the same)
alert(str8.slice(6, 2));    // "" (an empty string)
// Negative arguments are (unlike slice) not supported, they are treated as 0 .
// str.substr(start [, length])
// Returns the part of the string from start , with the given length .
// In contrast with the previous methods, this one allows us to specify the length instead of the ending position:
alert(str8.substr(2, 4));    // // 'ring', from the 2nd position get 4 characters
// The first argument may be negative, to count from the end:
alert(str8.substr(-4, 2));    // 'gi', from the 4th position get 2 characters


// Comparing strings
// As we know from the chapter Comparisons, strings are compared character-by-character in alphabetical order.
// Although, there are some oddities.
// 1. A lowercase letter is always greater than the uppercase:
alert('a' > 'Z');    // true
// 2. 2. Letters with diacritical marks are “out of order”:
alert('Osterreich' > 'Zealand');    // true
// This may lead to strange results if we sort these country names. Usually people would expect Zealand to
// come after Österreich in the list.
// To understand what happens, we should be aware that strings in Javascript are encoded using UTF-16. That is:
// each character has a corresponding numeric code.
// There are special methods that allow to get the character for the code and back:
// str.codePointAt(pos)
// Returns a decimal number representing the code for the character at position pos :
//    different case letters have different codes
alert("Z".codePointAt(0));    // 90
alert("z".codePointAt(0));    // 122
alert("Z".codePointAt(0).toString(16));    // 7a (if we need a hexadecimal value)
// String.fromCodePoint(code)
// Creates a character by its numeric code
alert(String.fromCodePoint(90));    // Z
alert(String.fromCodePoint(0x5a));    // Z (we can also use a hex value)
// Now let’s see the characters with codes 65..220 (the latin alphabet and a little bit extra) by making a string of
// them:
let str9 = '';
for (let i = 65; i <= 220; i++)
{
    str9 += String.fromCodePoint(i);
}
alert(str9);
// See? Capital characters go ﬁrst, then a few special ones, then lowercase characters, and Ö near the end of the
// output.
// Now it becomes obvious why a > Z .
// The characters are compared by their numeric code. The greater code means that the character is greater. The
// code for a (97) is greater than the code for Z (90).
// ● All lowercase letters go after uppercase letters because their codes are greater.
// ● Some letters like Ö stand apart from the main alphabet. Here, its code is greater than anything from a to z

// Correct comparisons
// The call str.localeCompare(str2) returns an integer indicating whether str is less, equal or greater than str2
// according to the language rules:
// ● Returns a negative number if str is less than str2 .
// ● Returns a positive number if str is greater than str2 .
// ● Returns 0 if they are equivalent.
// For instance:
alert('Osterreich'.localeCompare('Zealand'));    // -1
