// Arrays
// Declaration
// There are two syntaxes for creating an empty array:
let arr = new Array();
let arr1 = [];
// Almost all the time, the second syntax is used. We can supply initial elements in the brackets:
let fruits = arr["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
// Array elements are numbered, starting with zero.
// We can get an element by its number in square brackets:
console.log(fruits[0]);    // Apple
console.log(fruits[1]);    // Orange
console.log(fruits[2]);    // Plum
// We can replace an element:
fruits[2] = 'Pear';    // now ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"]
// Or add a new one to the array:
fruits[3] = 'Lemon';    // now ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear", "Lemon"]
// The total count of the elements in the array is its length :
console.log(fruits.length);    // 4
// We can also use alert to show the whole array.
alert(fruits);    // Apple, Orange, Pear, Lemon
// An array can store elements of any type. For instance:
let arr2 = ['Apple', {name: 'John'}, true, function (){alert('Hello World!')}];
// get the object at index 1 and then show its name
console.log(arr2[1].name);    // John
// get the function at index 3 and run it
arr2[3]();

// Get last elements with "at"
console.log(fruits[fruits.length - 1]);    // Lemon
// A bit cumbersome, isn’t it? We need to write the variable name twice.
// Luckily, there’s a shorter syntax: fruits.at(-1) :
console.log(fruits.at(-1));

// Methods pop/push, shift/unshift
// A queue is one of the most common uses of an array. In computer science, this means an ordered collection of
// elements which supports two operations:
// ● push appends an element to the end.
// ● shift get an element from the beginning, advancing the queue, so that the 2nd element becomes the 1st.
// Arrays support both operations.
// In practice we need it very often. For example, a queue of messages that need to be shown on-screen.
// There’s another use case for arrays – the data structure named stack.
// It supports two operations:
// ● push adds an element to the end.
// ● pop takes an element from the end.
// So new elements are added or taken always from the “end”.
// A stack is usually illustrated as a pack of cards: new cards are added to the top or taken from the top:
// For stacks, the latest pushed item is received ﬁrst, that’s also called LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. For
// queues, we have FIFO (First-In-First-Out).
// Arrays in JavaScript can work both as a queue and as a stack. They allow you to add/remove elements, both
// to/from the beginning or the end.
// In computer science, the data structure that allows this, is called deque.
// Methods that work with the end of the array:
// pop
// Extracts the last element of the array and returns it:
console.log(fruits.pop());    // remove Lemon
// Both fruits.pop() and fruits.at(-1) return the last element of the array, but fruits.pop() also
// modiﬁes the array by removing it.
// push
// Append the element to the end of the array:
fruits.push("Lemon");
// The call fruits.push(...) is equal to fruits[fruits.length] = ... .
// Methods that work with the beginning of the array:
// shift
// Extracts the ﬁrst element of the array and returns it:
console.log(fruits.shift());    // remove Apple
// unshift
// Add the element to the beginning of the array:
fruits.unshift('Apple');
// Methods push and unshift can add multiple elements at once:
fruits.push("Pineapple", "Lemon");
fruits.unshift("Pineapple", "Lemon");
// Internals
// There are only eight basic data types in JavaScript (see the Data types chapter for more info). Array
// is an object and thus behaves like an object.
// For instance, it is copied by reference:
let fruits1 = ["Banana"];
let arr4 = fruits1;    // copy by reference (two variables reference the same array
alert(arr4 === fruits1);    // true
arr4.push("Pear");    // modify the array by reference
alert(fruits1);    // Banana, Pear - 2 items now
// Performance
// Methods push/pop run fast, while shift/unshift are slow.

// Loops
// One of the oldest ways to cycle array items is the for loop over indexes:
let arr5 = ["Apple","Orange", "Pear"];
for (let i = 0; i < arr5.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr5[i]);
}
// But for arrays there is another form of loop, for..of :
for (let fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit);
}
// The for..of doesn’t give access to the number of the current element, just its value, but in most cases that’s
// enough. And it’s shorter.
// Technically, because arrays are objects, it is also possible to use for..in :
for (let key of arr5) {
    console.log(arr5[key]);
}
// But that’s actually a bad idea. There are potential problems with it:
// 1. The loop for..in iterates over all properties, not only the numeric ones.
// There are so-called “array-like” objects in the browser and in other environments, that look like arrays. That is,
// they have length and indexes properties, but they may also have other non-numeric properties and
// methods, which we usually don’t need. The for..in loop will list them though. So if we need to work with
// array-like objects, then these “extra” properties can become a problem.
// 2. The for..in loop is optimized for generic objects, not arrays, and thus is 10-100 times slower. Of course,
// it’s still very fast. The speedup may only matter in bottlenecks. But still we should be aware of the diﬀerence.
// Generally, we shouldn’t use for..in for arrays.

// A word about "length"
// The length property automatically updates when we modify the array. To be precise, it is actually not the count
// of values in the array, but the greatest numeric index plus one.
// For instance, a single element with a large index gives a big length:
let fruits2 = [];
fruits2[123] = "Apple";
console.log(fruits2.length);
// Note that we usually don’t use arrays like that.
// Another interesting thing about the length property is that it’s writable.
// If we increase it manually, nothing interesting happens. But if we decrease it, the array is truncated. The process
// is irreversible, here’s the example:
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
array.length = 2;    // truncate to 2 elements
alert(array);    // [1, 2]
array.length = 5;    // return length back
alert(array);    // undefined: the values do not return
// So, the simplest way to clear the array is: arr.length = 0;

// new Array()
// There is one more syntax to create an array:
let arr6 = new Array("Apple", "Pear", "etc");
// It’s rarely used, because square brackets [] are shorter. Also, there’s a tricky feature with it.
// If new Array is called with a single argument which is a number, then it creates an array without items, but
// with the given length.
// Let’s see how one can shoot themselves in the foot:
let array1 = new Array(2);    // will it create an array of [2] ?
alert( array1[0] );    // undefined! no elements.
alert(array1.length);    // length 2
// To avoid such surprises, we usually use square brackets, unless we really know what we’re doing.

// Multidimensional arrays
// Arrays can have items that are also arrays. We can use it for multidimensional arrays, for example to store
// matrices:
let matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
];
console.log(matrix[1][1]);    // 5, the central element

// Don't compare arrays with ==
// Arrays in JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages, shouldn’t be compared with operator == .
// This operator has no special treatment for arrays, it works with them as with any objects.
// Let’s recall the rules:
// ● Two objects are equal == only if they’re references to the same object.
// ● If one of the arguments of == is an object, and the other one is a primitive, then the object gets converted to
//   primitive, as explained in the chapter Object to primitive conversion.
// ●…With an exception of null and undefined that equal == each other and nothing else.
// The strict comparison === is even simpler, as it doesn’t convert types.
// So, if we compare arrays with == , they are never the same, unless we compare two variables that reference
// exactly the same array.
// For example:
console.log([] == []);    // false
console.log([0] == [0]);    // false
// These arrays are technically diﬀerent objects. So they aren’t equal. The == operator doesn’t do item-by-item
// comparison.
// Comparison with primitives may give seemingly strange results as well:
alert( 0 == [] );    // true
alert('0' == [] );    // false
// Here, in both cases, we compare a primitive with an array object. So the array [] gets converted to primitive for
// the purpose of comparison and becomes an empty string '' .
// Then the comparison process goes on with the primitives, as described in the chapter Type Conversions:
// after [] was converted to ''
alert( 0 == '' );    // true, as '' becomes converted to number 0
alert('0' == '' );    // false, no type conversion, different strings
// So, how to compare arrays?
// That’s simple: don’t use the == operator. Instead, compare them item-by-item in a loop or using iteration
// methods explained in the next chapter.
