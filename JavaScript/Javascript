JAVASCRIPT:
Always load your JS code last in your html file. Make sure that script tags are not within the head tags in your html file but come after the body tags . The script tags must be the last tags within
your html file. This is to ensure that html  loads first and JS executes later.
Refer to jsdoc.app for JS documentation reference

Variables:
In JavaScript, you create a variable using let, const, or var keyword:
let: use this when you might want to change the value
const: use this when the value should stay the same.
var: An older way of creating variables, but now we usually use let or const.

Rules For Naming Variables:
A variable must begin with a letter, $, or _.
A variable must not begin with a number.
Can contain letters, digits, $, and _. The digits only come after the first character.
Variable names are case-sensitive.
Variables cannot make use of reserved keywords.
Variable names should not have spaces.
Use descriptive names.

DataTypes:
Define the kind of value the variable is holding.
There are two kinds of data types. 1. Primitive types 2. Reference types.
Primitive Types:
Number -> Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
String -> Represents sequence of characters.
Boolean -> Represents true or false.
Undefined -> No value assigned.
Null -> Represents intentional absence of value.
Reference Types:
Object -> Used to store complex data in form of key value pairs.
Array -> Used to hold multiple values.

Statically Typed Language:
Example: Java
Variables cannot change their type during the program's execution.
Dynamically Typed Language:
Example: JavaScript

Expression:
An expression in JavaScript is any valid unit of code that produces a value. let a = 8 * 3 - 4 / 2;
Literal:
A literal is a fixed value that you write directly in the code. let a = 30; 30 is a numerical(number) literal.
Operators:
Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform operations on operands. let a = 8 * 3 - 4 / 2; *, -, / are operators.
Types of Operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators:
   - Addition (+)
   - Subtraction (-)
   - Multiplication (*)
   - Division (/)
   - Modulus (%)
   - Increment (++)
   - Decrement (--)
2. Assignment Operators:
   - Assignment (=)
   - Addition assignment (+=)
   - Subtraction assignment (-=)
   - Multiplication assignment (*=)
   - Division assignment (/=)
3. Comparison Operators:
   - Equality (==)
   - Strict equality (===)
   - Inequality (!=)
   - Strict inequality (!==)
   - Greater than (>)
   - Less than (<)
   - Greater than or equal to (>=)
   - Less than or equal to (<=)
4. Logical operators:
   - Logical AND (&&)
   - Logical OR (||)
   - Logical NOT (!)
5. Unary Operators:
   - Increment (++)
   - Decrement (--)
   - typeof operator
   - Logical NOT (!)
6. Ternary Operator:
   - Conditional operator (condition ? value1 : value2)

Logical AND (&&)
The AND operator (&&) checks if BOTH conditions are true. It returns true only if both are true, otherwise, it returns false.

Logical OR (||):
The OR operator (||) checks if AT LEAST ONE condition is true.  It returns true if at least one value is true; if both are false, it returns false.

Logical NOT (!):
The NOT operator (!) inverts the value of a Boolean. It returns true into false and false into true.

Ternary Operator:
 - Conditional operator
   (condition ? expression1 : expression2)

Arrays:
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
Creating Arrays:
You can create an array by enclosing its elements within square brackets ([]). e.g. let fruits = ["Apple", "Watermelon", "Passion", "Pineapple"]
Array Methods:
push(): Adds an element to the end.
pop(): Removes the last element.
shift(): Removes the first element.
unshift(): Adds an element to the beginning.
slice(): Returns a portion of an array.
splice(): Modifies the array by removing or replacing elements at a specific index.
map(): Transforms each element and returns a new array
filter(): Returns a new array with elements that pass
reduce(): Reduces the array to a single value.
forEach(): Executes a function for each array element.
find(): Returns the first element that satisfies a
some(): Checks if at least one element  passes a test.
every(): Checks if all elements pass a test.
concat(): Merges arrays into a new array.
join(): Joins all elements into a string.
reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements.
sort(): Sorts the elements of an array.

Objects:
Objects allow you to group related data and functions together.
An object is created using curly braces '{}' and contains key-value pairs, where each key (also called a property) is associated with a value.

Type Conversion:
Javascript is a loosely typed language.
Javascript supports implicit and explicit conversion.
Converting values explicitly:
toString(), String(), Number(), parseInt(), parseFloat(), Boolean()

Function:
A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task.
It can be reused multiple times.
Arrow functions:
Provide a more concise way of writing functions.

Template Literal:
Allows you to work with strings in a more flexible and readable way.

If statement:
It is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is `true`

Switch statement:
When dealing with multiple conditions for the same variable, `if...else` can become lengthy and hard to read.
The `switch` statement offers a cleaner, more readable alternative.

While loop:
Executes the statement as long as condition evaluates to true.

Callback functions:
This is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after a particular event or operation completes.

Promises:
Provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations
then(): When promise is fulfilled
catch(): When promise is rejected

Async/Await:
async/await - simplifies asynchronous code by making it look like synchronous code.
It improves readability and makes error handling straightforward with `try...catch`.
You can use `async/await` with multiple asynchronous operations, HTTP requests.

Try...Catch:
`try...catch` statement in JavaScript allows you to handle errors gracefully.

Closures:
Allow a function to access variables from its outer(enclosing) function scope.

Spread operators:
Spread Operator (...): Used to expand elements of an iterable (like arrays or strings) or properties of object into individual elements or properties.

Rest operator:
The rest operator (`...`) is used to collect multiple values into a single variable.
It is especially useful when working with an unknown or variable number of arguments.

Modules:
Modules help you break down large codebases into smaller, manageable parts.

JSON:
JSON is a lightweight data format commonly used for data exchange between the client and server.

Fetch API:
The fetch API provides an easy way to make network requests in Javascript.
Fetch returns a promise.

Axios:
This is a powerful HTTP client for making network requests in JavaScript.
`axios.get` is used to make a GET request.
`axios.post` is used to make a POST request.

Asynchronous Programming:
This is a process that allows an application to run a second set of instructions while focusing on its primary or basic process.
Asynchronous programming has several benefits, including improved application performance, wide application to different coding languages, and better user experience.
A few use cases for asynchronous programming include reduced inefficiencies from an application and efficient data collection.
Promise:
A promise is an assurance or guarantee that something will happen in the future. A person can promise another person a specific outcome or result. A Promise is an object
that holds the future value of an async operation.
Example: Requesting some data from a server, the promise, promises us to get that data which we can use in future.
