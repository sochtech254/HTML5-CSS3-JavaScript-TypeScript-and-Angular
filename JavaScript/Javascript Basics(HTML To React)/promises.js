// Promises are basically another way to deal with asynchronous programming.
// These simplify your async code greatly.
// Before we defined the fetchAndPrintUser function which fetches the user details and prints the user
// But, this time instead of passing any callback function we create a new promise
// New promise can be created as below
// const newPromise = new Promise();

// What is a promise?
// Promise is literally a promise made by some function
// That it will eventually return the result and fulfil that promise
//  is a proxy for a value that will eventually become available

// The Promise object itself takes a callback function with two functions as parameters
// resolve - function to be called after successful data retrieval
// reject - function to be called if there was some error during data retrieval
// So, in the example below we return Promise from the fetchAndPrintUser function
// Once the data is available we return the data using resolve(fakeUserName)
// If there were any network error server failure - we would return error by rejecting the promise
// --> This is done using reject('Error occurred!')
/*function fetchAndPrintUser() {

    // create new promise
    return new Promise(resolve => {

        // simulate fake network call
        setTimeout(() => {

            // simulate error
            // when error occurs we reject the promise
            if (someError) {
                reject('Error occurred');
            }

            const fakeUserName = 'Sleepless Yogi';

            // Resolve the user name
            resolve(fakeUserName);
        }, 500)
    })
}*/

// The usage of promise is done via promise.then.catch pattern
// This means if the data is correctly resolved the execution goes in the then() block
// --> Where you can do any other thing with the result data
// If the promise was rejected due to some error the execution would go in the catch() block
// --> Where you can handle errors
// This is demonstrated below

// Execute function that fetch user and then prints it
/*fetchAndPrintUser()
    .then((name) => {
        console.log(name);
    })
.catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
})*/
