DOM:
The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) used for manipulating content, style and structure of HTML documents.
The DOM provides functions that allow you to add, remove, and modify parts of the document effectively.
The DOM represents an HTML document as a tree of nodes.
Different types of nodes include: <!DOCTYPE html>, <head> </head>, <title></title>, <body></body> <p></p> even texts within title,h1 and p tags are also nodes.
Any node has relationships to other nodes in the DOM tree, and it is same as described in the traditional family tree. e.g. the <body></body> nodes is the child node of the <html></html> parent node.
The <body></body> node is the sibling node of the <head></head> node since they share the same parent node the <html></html> node.

Selecting Elements:
getElementById() method -> returns an element object that represents an HTML element.
getElementsByName() method ->
getElementsByTagName() method -> accepts a tag name and returns a live HTMLCollection of elements.
getElementsByClassName() method -> returns an array-like of objects of the child elements with a specified class name.
querySelector() & querySelectorAll() -> allows you to select the first element that matches one or more CSS selectors.

Traversing elements:
To get the parent node of a specified node in the DOM tree, we can use the parentNode property.

Manipulating elements:
createElement() Method -> To create an HTML element, we use the createElement() method. The document.createElement() accepts an HTML tag name and returns a new Node with the Element type.
appendChild() Method -> Use appendChild() method to add a node to the end of the list of child nodes of a specified parent node. The appendChild() can be used to move an existing child node to the
new position within the document.
textContent -> To get the text content of a node and its descendants, you use the textContent property.
after() -> We can use after() method to insert one or more nodes after the element.
append() -> same as appendChild() but can be used to add multiple elements unlike the appendChild() method.
insertBefore() -> used to insert a new node before an existing node as a child node of a parent node.

Event bubbling:
Event starts at the most specific element and flows towards least specific element.

Event capturing:
Event starts at the least specific element and flows toward the most specific element.

Event handler:
Also known as event listener. This is a piece of code that will be executed when the event occurs.
When the event occurs, the web browser passes an event object to the event handler.
"this" keyword inside the event handler refers to target element.
addEventListener() method will register an event handler.
removeEventListener() method will remove an event handler.

Events:
mousemove -> event fires repeatedly when you move the mouse cursor around the element.
mousedown -> event fires when you press the mouse button on the element.
mouseup -> event fires when you release the mouse button on the element.
mouseover -> event fires when the cursor move from outside to inside the boundaries of the element.
mouseout -> event fires when the cursor is over an element and then moves to another element.
keydown -> event fires when you press a key on the keyboard and fires repeatedly while you're holding down the key.
keyup -> event fires when you release a key on the keyboard.
keypress -> event fires when you press a character on keyboard like a,b,c... it fires repeatedly while you hold down the key on the keyboard.
scroll -> event fires when you scroll a document or on element, the scroll events fire.

Event propagation:
There are three phases:
1. Event Capturing
2. Target
3. Event Bubbling

Event Delegation:
It allows users to append a SINGLE event listener to a parent element that adds it to all of its present AND future descendants that match a selector.

There are three ways to assign event handler:
